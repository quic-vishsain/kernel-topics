	  This driver provides support for Trigger Generation Unit that is
	  used to detect patterns or sequences on a given set of signals.
	  TGU is used to monitor a particular bus within a given region to
	  detect illegal transaction sequences or slave responses. It is also
	  used to monitor a data stream to detect protocol violations and to
	  provide a trigger point for centering data around a specific event
	  within the trace data buffer.
